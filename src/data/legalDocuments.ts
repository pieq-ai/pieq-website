<h3>1.3 User Accounts</h3>
<p>Your account on the Service (your "User Account") gives you access to the services and functionality that we may establish and maintain from time to time and in our sole discretion.

If you open a User Account on behalf of a company, organization, or other entity, then (i) "you" includes you and that entity, and (ii) you represent and warrant that you are an authorized representative of the entity with the authority to bind the entity to this Agreement, and that you agree to this Agreement on the entity's behalf. You further agree that you are solely responsible for all acts and omissions associated with your access and use of the Service and the access and use of the Service by anyone on your behalf.</p>

<p>You may never use another User's User Account without permission. When creating your User Account, you must provide accurate and complete information, and you must keep this information up to date.

<p>The Service is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. Use of the Service is at your own risk. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the Service is provided without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by you from PieQ or through the Service will create any warranty not expressly stated herein. Without limiting the foregoing, PieQ, its subsidiaries, its affiliates, and its licensors do not warrant that the content is accurate, reliable or correct; that the Service will meet your requirements; that the Service will be available at any particular time or location, uninterrupted or secure; that any defects or errors will be corrected; or that the Service is free of viruses or other harmful components. Any content downloaded or otherwise obtained through the use of the Service is downloaded at your own risk and you will be solely responsible for any damage to your computer system or mobile device or loss of data that results from such download or your use of the Service.</p>

<p>Further, PieQ does not warrant, endorse, guarantee, or assume responsibility for any product or service advertised or offered by a third party through the Service or any hyperlinked website or service, and PieQ will not be a party to or in any way monitor any transaction between you and third-party providers of products or services.</p>

<p>Federal law, some states, provinces and other jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion and limitations of certain implied warranties, so the above exclusions may not apply to you. This Agreement gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights which vary from state to state. The disclaimers and exclusions under this Agreement will not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law.</p>

<h2>11. Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall PieQ, its affiliates, agents, directors, employees, suppliers or licensors be liable for any indirect, punitive, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages, including without limitation damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses, arising out of or relating to the use of, or inability to use, the Service. Under no circumstances will PieQ be responsible for any damage, loss or injury resulting from hacking, tampering or other unauthorized access or use of the Service or your account or the information contained therein.</p>

<p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, PieQ assumes no liability or responsibility for any (i) errors, mistakes, or inaccuracies of content; (ii) personal injury or property damage, of any nature whatsoever, resulting from your access to or use of our service; (iii) any unauthorized access to or use of our secure servers and/or any and all personal information stored therein; (iv) any interruption or cessation of transmission to or from the Service; (v) any bugs, viruses, trojan horses, or the like that may be transmitted to or through our service by any third party; (vi) any errors or omissions in any content or for any loss or damage incurred as a result of the use of any content posted, emailed, transmitted, or otherwise made available through the Service; and/or (vii) User Content or the defamatory, offensive, or illegal conduct of any third party.

<p>This limitation of liability section applies whether the alleged liability is based on contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or any other basis, even if PieQ has been advised of the possibility of such damage.</p>

<p>Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to you. This Agreement gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights which vary from state to state. The disclaimers, exclusions, and limitations of liability under this Agreement will not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law.</p>

<h2>12. Governing Law, Arbitration, and Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver</h2>

<h3>12.1 Governing Law</h3>
<p>You agree that: (i) the Service shall be deemed solely based in Pennsylvania; and (ii) the Service shall be deemed a passive one that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over us, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than Pennsylvania. This Agreement shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of Pennsylvania, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The parties acknowledge that this Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences with respect to the substantive law, any arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16). The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth in the Arbitration provision below, including any provisional relief required to prevent irreparable harm. You agree that Philadelphia, Pennsylvania is the proper forum for any appeals of an arbitration award or for trial court proceedings in the event that the arbitration provision below is found to be unenforceable.</p>

<h3>12.2 Arbitration</h3>
<p>Read this section carefully because it requires the parties to arbitrate their disputes and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from PieQ. For any dispute with PieQ, you agree to first contact us at <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&fs=1&to=support@pieq.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-orange-500 hover:text-orange-600 underline">support@pieq.ai</a> and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that PieQ has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as provided below) arising out of or in connection with or relating to this Agreement, or the breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, "Claims"), by binding arbitration by JAMS, under the Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in effect for JAMS, except as provided herein. JAMS may be contacted at www.jamsadr.com. The arbitration will be conducted in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, unless you and PieQ agree otherwise. Each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules, and the award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys' fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall be deemed as preventing PieQ from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our data security, Intellectual Property Rights or other proprietary rights.</p>

<h3>12.3 Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver</h3>
<p>With respect to all persons and entities, regardless of whether they have obtained or used the Service for personal, commercial or other purposes, all Claims must be brought in the parties' individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action, collective action, private attorney general action or other representative proceeding. This waiver applies to class arbitration, and, unless we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's Claims. You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and PieQ are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action, collective action, private attorney general action, or other representative proceeding of any kind.</p>

<h2>13. Additional Terms for Mobile Applications</h2>

<h3>13.1 Mobile Applications</h3>

Any third-party code that may be incorporated in the Mobile Applications is covered by the applicable open source or third-party license EULA, if any, authorizing use of such code. The foregoing license grant is not a sale of the Mobile Applications or any copy thereof, and PieQ or its third-party partners or suppliers retain all right, title, and interest in the Mobile Applications (and any copy thereof). Any attempt by you to transfer any of the rights, duties or obligations hereunder, except as expressly provided for in this Agreement, is void.

<h3>13.2 Mobile Applications from Apple App Store</h3>
<p>The following applies to any Mobile Applications you acquire from the Apple App Store ("Apple-Sourced Software"): You acknowledge and agree that this Agreement is solely between you and PieQ, not Apple, Inc.

<p><strong>At Your Request.</strong> We may disclose your information publicly or with another third party with your prior authorization.</p>

<h2 id="cookies">3. HOW WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES TO COLLECT INFORMATION</h2>
<p>We, and our third-party partners, automatically collect certain types of usage information when you visit our Sites, read our emails, or otherwise engage with us online. We typically collect this information through a variety of tracking technologies, including cookies, web beacons, embedded scripts, location-identifying technologies, file information, and similar technology (collectively, "tracking technologies").</p>

<p>We, and our third-party partners, use tracking technologies to automatically collect usage and device information, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Information about your device and its software, such as your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, device type/model/manufacturer, operating system, date and time stamp, and a unique ID that allows us to uniquely identify your browser or your account (including, for example, a persistent device identifier or an Ad ID), and other such information. We may also work with third-party partners to employ technologies, including the application of statistical modeling tools, which permit us to recognize and contact you across multiple devices.</li>
<li>When you access our Sites from a mobile device, we may collect unique identification numbers associated with your device or our mobile application (including, for example, a UDID, Unique ID for Advertisers ("IDFA"), Google AdID, or Windows Advertising ID), mobile carrier, device type, model and manufacturer, mobile device operating system brand and model, phone number, and depending on your mobile device settings, your geographical location data, including GPS coordinates (e.g., latitude and/or longitude) or similar information regarding the location of your mobile device, or we may be able to approximate a device's location by analyzing other information, like an IP address.</li>
<li>Information about the way you access and use our Sites, for example, the site from which you came and the site to which you are going when you leave our Sites, the pages you visit, the links you click, whether you open emails or click the links contained in emails, whether you access the Website from multiple devices, and other actions you take on the Sites.</li>
</ul>

<p>We may collect analytics data or use third-party analytics tools such as Google Analytics to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the services and to understand more about the demographics of our Website visitors. You can learn more about Google's practices at <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-orange-500 hover:text-orange-600 underline">https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites</a> and view its opt-out options at <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-orange-500 hover:text-orange-600 underline">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>.</p>

<p>We use the data collected through tracking technologies to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information, including targeted content and advertising; (c) identify you across multiple devices; (d) provide and monitor the effectiveness of our services; (e) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, usage, and demographic patterns on our website; (f) diagnose or fix technology problems; and (g) otherwise to plan for and enhance our services.</p>

<h2 id="third-party">4. THIRD-PARTY TRACKING AND ONLINE ADVERTISING</h2>

<h3>A. Online Advertising.</h3>

<p><strong>Interest-Based Advertising.</strong> We participate in interest-based advertising and use third-party advertising companies to serve you targeted advertisements based on your browsing history. We may share or we may permit third-party online advertising networks, social media companies, and other third-party services to collect information about your use of our website over time so that they may play or display ads on our Service, on other devices you may use, and on other websites, apps, or services, including on Facebook. Typically, though not always, the information we share is provided through cookies or similar tracking technologies, which recognize the device you are using and collect information, including click stream information, browser type, time and date you visited the site, and other information. We and our third-party partners use this information to make the advertisements you see online more relevant to your interests, as well as to provide advertising-related services such as reporting, attribution, analytics, and market research.</p>

<p><strong>Social Media Widgets and Advertising.</strong> Our Service may include social media features, such as the Facebook button, Google, LinkedIn, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, or other widgets. These social media companies may recognize you and collect information about your visit to our Service, and they may set a cookie or employ other tracking technologies. Your interactions with those features are governed by the privacy policies of those companies.</p>

<p>We display targeted advertising to you through social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, Google, and others. These companies have interest-based advertising programs that allow us to direct advertisements to users who have shown interest in our Service while those users are on the social media platform or to groups of other users who share similar traits, such as likely commercial interests and demographics. These advertisements are governed by the privacy policies of those social media companies that provide them.</p>

<p><strong>Cross-Device Linking.</strong> We, or our third-party partners, may link your various devices so that content you see on one device can result in relevant advertising on another device. We do this by collecting information about each device you use when you are logged in to our Service. We may also work with third-party partners who employ tracking technologies or the application of statistical modeling tools to determine if two or more devices are linked to a single user or household. We may share a common account identifier (such as an email address or user ID) with third-party advertising partners to help recognize you across devices. We, and our partners, can use this cross-device linkage to serve interest-based advertising and other personalized content to you across your devices, to perform analytics, and to measure the performance of our advertising campaigns.</p>

<p><strong>Google Analytics and Advertising.</strong> We utilize certain forms of display advertising and other advanced features through Google Analytics, such as Remarketing with Google Analytics, the DoubleClick Campaign Manager Integration, Google Ads, and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting. These features enable us to use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick advertising cookie) or other third-party cookies together to inform, optimize, and display ads based on your past visits to the Service. You may control your advertising preferences or opt-out of certain Google advertising products by visiting the Google Ads Preferences Manager, currently available at <a href="https://google.com/ads/preferences" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-orange-500 hover:text-orange-600 underline">https://google.com/ads/preferences</a>, or by visiting NAI's online resources at <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-orange-500 hover:text-orange-600 underline">http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices</a>.</p>

<h3>B. Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies Opt-Out</h3>
<p>We support the self-regulatory principles of the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA"). We work with advertisers, advertising networks, advertising servers, and analytics companies ("Ad Partners") that use data collection technologies to understand how our Service are being used and to analyze your location and browsing history in order to deliver advertising relevant to your interests, as well as to provide advertising-related insights such as reporting, attribution, analytics, and market research. These advertisements may appear on our Service or other websites or services, including through social media networks. These Ad Partners may be able to associate devices across third party websites or services over time and link various devices used by the same individual.</p>

<p>For more information about how Ad Partners use the information collected by these technologies and your options for restricting cookies placed by some of these Ad Partners, please visit the <a href="http://optout.aboutads.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-orange-500 hover:text-orange-600 underline">DAA's opt-out page</a>. The DAA's opt-outs are device- and browser-specific and may not work on all devices. If you choose to opt-out through the DAA's tools it does not mean you will cease to see advertising. Rather, the ads you see will be based on the website you are visiting and not your interests.</p>

<p>You may also be able to limit interest-based advertising through the settings menu on your mobile device by selecting "limit ad tracking" (iOS) or "opt-out of interest-based ads" (Android). You may also be able to opt-out of some — but not all — interest-based advertising served by mobile ad networks by visiting <a href="http://youradchoices.com/appchoices" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-orange-500 hover:text-orange-600 underline">http://youradchoices.com/appchoices</a> and downloading the mobile AppChoices app.</p>

<p>Please note that when you opt out of receiving interest-based advertisements, this does not mean you will no longer see advertisements from us or on our online services. It means that the online ads that you do see from DAA program participants should not be based on your interests. We are not responsible for the effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties' opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs. In addition, third parties may still use cookies to collect information about your use of our online services, including for analytics and fraud prevention as well as any other purpose permitted under the DAA's Principles.</p>

<h2 id="privacy-choices">5. PRIVACY CHOICES</h2>
<p>You have some choices regarding how we use your personal information, including the following:</p>

<p><strong>Access to Your Device Information.</strong> You may control the access to your device information through your "Settings" app on your device. For instance, you can withdraw permission for the Sites to access your geolocation, camera, and integrations with your other applications.</p>

We may not be able to modify or delete your information in all circumstances.</p>

<h2 id="data-protection">6. DATA PROTECTION</h2>
<p>PieQ cares about the security of your information and uses commercially reasonable physical, technical and organizational measures designed to preserve the integrity and security of all information we collect. However, no security system is impenetrable and we cannot guarantee the security of our systems 100%. In the event that any information under our control is compromised as a result of a breach of security, we will take reasonable steps to investigate the situation and where appropriate, notify those individuals whose information may have been compromised and take other steps, in accordance with any applicable laws and regulations.</p>

<p>We store data on servers in the U.S. or any other country in which PieQ or its affiliates, subsidiaries, agents or contractors maintain facilities. If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that your personal information may be transferred to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction.</p>

<h2 id="links">7. LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES AND SERVICES</h2>
<p>The Services may contain links to third party websites or services, including those of our business partners and social media sites. Our Services may also include buttons and widgets hosted by other companies (for example, the Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn and YouTube "Share" buttons). Some of these features collect personal information or other information such as your IP address and information about the websites you have visited.</p>

<p>This privacy policy does not apply to the practices of these or any other third parties. PieQ is not responsible for the privacy practices of any entity that it does not own or control. We encourage you to review the privacy policies and terms of those third parties to learn more about their privacy practices.</p>

<h2 id="children">8. CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</h2>
<p>We do not knowingly collect or solicit any information from anyone under the age of 13 on the Service and the Service is not targeted towards anyone under the age of 13. If you believe that we might have received information from a child under 13, please contact us at <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&fs=1&to=privacy@pieq.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-orange-500 hover:text-orange-600 underline">privacy@pieq.ai</a>.</p>

<h2 id="california">9. YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</h2>
<p>If you are a California resident, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits you to request information regarding the disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes during the immediately preceding calendar year. To opt out of having your information shared in this manner, please email us at <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&fs=1&to=privacy@pieq.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-orange-500 hover:text-orange-600 underline">privacy@pieq.ai</a>.</p>

<h2 id="changes">10. CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
<p>We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy from time to time in our sole discretion. If we revise this Privacy Policy in a way that will materially change the way we use your personal information, we will notify you by sending a notice to the primary email address specified in your PieQ account or by placing a prominent notice on our website. It is your responsibility to review this Privacy Policy periodically. When we do change the Privacy Policy, we will also revise the "last modified" date above.</p>
